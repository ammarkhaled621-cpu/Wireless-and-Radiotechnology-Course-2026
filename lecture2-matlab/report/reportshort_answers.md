# Short Answers (Lecture-2)

## Q1
The time domain representation shows how a signal varies with time, which helps us observe its waveform and amplitude changes.
The frequency domain representation shows the frequency components contained in the signal and their strengths.
Frequency domain analysis is very useful in RF systems because it clearly reveals the signal spectrum.

## Q2
Filtering is important in RF receivers because it allows the desired signal to pass while suppressing unwanted frequencies.
It reduces noise and interference and improves the quality of the received signal.
Without filtering, different signals would overlap and cause distortion.

## Q3
Modulation shifts a low-frequency information signal to a higher carrier frequency.
This makes wireless transmission possible over long distances.
It also allows multiple signals to be transmitted simultaneously using different carrier frequencies.

## Q4
The low-pass filter was the easiest to design.
It requires only one cutoff frequency and is simple to apply.
Its effect on the signal is clear and easy to observe in the frequency spectrum.

## Q5
After modulation, the signal spectrum is shifted to higher frequencies.
New frequency components appear around the carrier frequency.
These components are located at the carrier frequency plus and minus the message frequency.
